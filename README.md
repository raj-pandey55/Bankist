# Bankist

It is a simple banking app in which i used some saved data in the form of JSON to show the movements in an account. 
This App has three functonalities:-

1. User can transfer money from one account to different account.
2. User can request for loan and if the loan meets the given conditions then it is granted to the user.
3. User can also close the account if they want too

It can also sort the movements on the account and the user will be logged out if they remain Inactive for a certain period of time.
